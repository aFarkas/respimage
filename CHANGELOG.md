# CHANGELOG

### 1.4.0/1.4.1

* renamed ``reparse`` option to ``reevaluate`` (better compatibility with picturefill)
* Changed candidate selection for more quality especially on lower resolution devices
* added video/vnd.mozilla.apng and video/x-apng types for apng in typesupport plugin (only 1.4.1)

### 1.3.1

* fix intrinsic dimension plugin in IE11 in conjunction with SVG images
* allow complex combined media conditions in ``sizes`` attribute

### 1.2.1

* fixes intrinsic sizes plugin sometimes disconnects MutationObserver
* improve media attribute order in conjunction with type attribute
* use lqip pattern also in browsers, which support image abortion (improves speedindex)
* improve mutation performance for browsers without MuationObserver support
* be more memory efficient

### 1.2.0

* improved performance for upcoming FF 36+
* decoupled intrinsic sizing from resource selection (makes [intrinsic size plugin smoother](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/gs3p14pr/embedded/result/))
* added SEO pattern
* improved documentation
* changed config options
* simplified and improved smart source selection
* modification to the lqip pattern. The time to the onload event is now more often increased, but perceived performance is much better.

### 1.1.6

* changed viewport calculation for IE8 to correspond to respondjs
* added experimental print extension plugin

### 1.1.5

* improved viewport width/height detection

### 1.1.4

* improved intrinsic sizes plugin
* improved ``currentSrc`` property and moved it to the [mutation plugin](plugins/mutation).
* refinements to the source selection algorithm. compared to previous version:
	* smart source selection runs less aggressive on 1x devices (better for quality).
	* smart source selection runs more aggressive on 2x+ devices (better for performance).
	* smart source selection runs less aggressive in portrait mode than in landscape mode (good for orientation change).
* implemented orientation media query polyfill (mainly for IE8 but also IE9).
* implemented ``srcset`` and ``src`` getter/setters into mutation plugin.
* removed perfselection plugin. (Non-biased part is now directly included into the main script. For the "biased" part [use some other x-browser techniques](plugins/perfselection).)

### 1.1.1-1.1.3

* no script changes, only adjustments to the package.json (sorry for the release noise)

### 1.1.0

* improve [intrinsic scaling and move it to a plugin](plugins/intrinsic-dimension)
* allow use of h descriptor (allow futureproof markup)
* make respimage lazier on resize
* improve image abortion for trident
* tests tests tests ;-)

### 1.0.0

* CSS calc function in the ``sizes`` attribute in conjunction with em/vw is now 100% precise and works even in IE8
* massive network performance improvement for the Trident engine (IE) if a ``src`` fallback attribute is specified

### 0.9.6

* improve addSize option

### 0.9.5

* improve memory usage
* add type support plugin
* fixed debug message (for source and size order) + added new debug messages

### 0.9.4

* handle changes to devicePixelRatio
* improve debugging information in *.dev.js (Test wether calculated sizes matches rendered size of image + Test order of source elements and sizes attribute)
* Stick to editorconfig in all files
* removed UMD (simply not so good for polyfills, sorry)
* Add `.editorconfig` file to ensure coding conventions
* Update npm dependencies
* add ``lazyload`` check

### v0.9.3-RC1
### v0.9.3
### v0.9.2
### v0.9.1
### v0.9.0-RC2
### v0.9.0
